# Not-Dookie-Game
Solo project made in 2018 using Python and Pygame! Based on a game designed and created by me in 2016 using Scratch: (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/111490363/). Different rendition of my game created in 2017 to show my progress as a programmer, and how my coding style has evolved over the years!

This game requires both hands and an intermediate amount of hand-eye coordination.

Instructions:
Use the W-A-S-D keys to control the character side to side and jump.
Tap the SPACEBAR to teleport your character the current mouse cursor location.

WATCH OUT FOR THE HADOUKENS!
